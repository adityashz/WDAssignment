      <h3>Welcome to my webpage consisting of Web Design Assignments</h3>
      <p>Web design is the process of creating websites. It encompasses several different aspects, including webpage layout, content production, and graphic design. While the terms web design and web development are often used interchangeably, web
        design is technically a subset of the broader category of web development.</p>
      <p>Websites are created using a markup language called HTML. Web designers build webpages using HTML tags that define the content and metadata of each page. The layout and appearance of the elements within a webpage are typically defined using
        CSS, or cascading style sheets. Therefore, most websites include a combination of HTML and CSS that defines how each page will appear in a browser.</p>

      </ul>

      <div class="assignment-row">
        <h3 id="assignment01">Assignment 01</h3>
        <p>You will create a home page which includes a list of all the assignments.
          You will create an HTML page that includes all the content in a proper arrangement in preparation for creating a CSS layout. The page should be
          placed in your web design folder and named index.html. The link on the first
          page of this syllabus should lead to this file. <br>
          <br>
          You should include:<br>
          ● A title in the title bar. <br>
          ● One image.<br>
          ● Your name.<br>
          ● A navigation scheme for the assignments: you should use “#” in place of
          the not-yet-completed links.<br>
          ● You also may include basic links to social media.<br>
          ● Other background information.<br>
          <br>
          The text and the links should be formatted using an external CSS page.
          You should also comment the code with at least four comments.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="assignment-row">
        <h3 id="assignment02">Assignment 02</h3>
        <p>Create a home page and a second page , using all the techniques learned so far,
          that represents that state of being. You are strongly encouraged to consider an
          appropriate navigation scheme and create a clear focal point. Your choice of
          color and typography selections will be considered in grading. You should
          “invent” appropriate text, if necessary. Think big. Think bold. The first page
          should be different from the second page, with the first page specifically aimed
          at attracting attention.<br>

          Your grade will be determined by:<br>
          ● Effective application of the “state of being.” <br>
          ● Presence of a title <br>
          ● Correct HTML/CSS <br>
          <br>
          <b>Aesthetic choices:</b><br>
          ● Font choice <br>
          ● Color choice <br>
          ● A clear focal point. <br>
          ● Creation of a reasonably complex layout (multiple divisions/content
          areas). <br>
          ● Creativity <br>
          ● Working links between the first and second page—these pages should be
          similar, and most likely use the same CSS page.

        <p><b>Responsive Sales/Business -Page Site </b><br>
          <br>
          Students will create a responsive web page following the model of a
          clothes-based business. The page will include a text (and possibly image)
          based logo and at least six images, along with text added to the images-not
          through Photoshop. A header (and title) must be included, as must
          (non-working) links to at least six pages within the site (that should not be
          created). <br>
          <br>
          Color choice, typography, and simplicity/appropriateness of images will be
          considered in grading. The HTML should validate with an external CSS file.
          The site must be responsive
